#summary Building and Booting the FreeBSD Kernel

= Introduction =

Very brief instructions on how to build the FreeBSD kernel using the code in the repository and then booting it on the BeagleBoard.


= Disclaimer =

These instructions work for me, however it's entirely likely that I may have missed some files that I should have uploaded to the repo, or my build system produces different binaries.

In addition, I build my kernel on OSX using a modified CodeSourcery ARM toolchain, I haven't tried building the kernel on a actual FreeBSD system.


= Building the Kernel =

Copy the files from the repo into the FreeBSD tree, I suggest you use some graphical merge program as some of my changes might not be applicable and unnecessary.  To build type the following command.

<pre>   buildkernel KERNCONF=BEAGLEBOARD TARGET=arm MACHINE_ARCH=arm</pre>

If you already have built once and just modified one or two files you can run the following commands which just builds the changed files and re-links.

<pre>   buildkernel KERNFAST=BEAGLEBOARD TARGET=arm MACHINE_ARCH=arm</pre>

The build process should produce a *kernel.bin* binary file.


= Running the Kernel =

Copy the *kernel.bin* file onto the root directory of a MMC or SD card and chuck it in the BeagleBoard. At the u-boot prompt, type the following:

<pre>   
*OMAP3 beagleboard.org #* mmc init
*OMAP3 beagleboard.org #* fatload mmc 0 0x80200000 kernel.bin
*OMAP3 beagleboard.org #* go 0x80200000
</pre>

After that you should see the kernel start-up messages coming out the serial port.
